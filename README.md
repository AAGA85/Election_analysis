# Election_analysis

## Project Overview
A Colorado Board of Elections employee has requested our assistance to audit the election results of a recent local congressional election. This project requires to develop specific tasks in Python to be able to deliver the following information:

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get the voter turnout for each county including the percentage of votes from each county out the total count.
3. Determine the county with the highest turnout.
4. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
5. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
6. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
7. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.

## Resources
- Data Source: election_results.cvs
- Software: Python 3.6.1, Visual Studio Code, 1.38.1

## Summary 
The analysis of the election show that:
- There were 369,711 votes cast in the election.
- The voter turnout for each county and their percentage of the total votes were:
    - Jefferson had 38,855 of voters who participated in the election: this represents 10.5% of the total votes.
    - Denver had 306,055 of voters who participated in the election: this represents 82.8% of the total votes. 
    - Arapahoe had 24,801 of voters who participated in the election: this represents 6.7% of the total votes.
- The county with the largest number of voters was Denver
- The candidates were:
    - Charles Casper Stockham
    - Diana DeGette
    - Raymon Anthony Doane
- The candidate results were:
    - Charles Casper Stockham received 23.0%  of the vote and 85,213 number of votes
    - Diana DeGette received 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 number of votes
    - Raymon Anthony Doane received 3.1% of the vote and 11,606 number of votes
- The winner of the election was:
    - Diana DeGette, who received 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 number of votes
    
 All this data has been summarized in the attached file called [***election analysis***](https://github.com/AAGA85/Election_analysis/blob/7769c16d94b39fac422425c1e0c8ba11dabd59bd/analysis/election_analysis.txt)
 
 The full script of this analysis can be found here [***Election Analysis code***] (https://github.com/AAGA85/Election_analysis/blob/7769c16d94b39fac422425c1e0c8ba11dabd59bd/PyPoll_Challenge.py)
 

## Challenge Overview

The challenge of this project  besides the presentation of audit results as requested, was to develop a code easy to use and modify to audit other types of elections. In order to meet with this challenge, the scrip includes a full and clear description of each task. The user can identify the comment of each taks with a # or number sign before each comment.

If the user wanto to get the same results as the Colorado Elections without code changes, the only thing that the new user has to do is to allocate the file to be load (the file where the program will read the data) to the current working directory, save the code and then run the code.
